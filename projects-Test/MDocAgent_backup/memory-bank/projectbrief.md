# MDocAgent Project Brief

## Project Overview
MDocAgent is a multi-modal multi-agent framework for document understanding that integrates text and image retrieval through five specialized agents:
- General agent
- Critical agent
- Text agent
- Image agent
- Summarizing agent

## Core Requirements
1. Python environment setup with Python 3.12
2. Installation of required dependencies
3. Data preparation and processing capabilities
4. Text and image retrieval functionality
5. Multi-agent inference system
6. Evaluation system with OpenAI API integration

## Project Goals
1. Enable collaborative reasoning across modalities for document QA
2. Improve document understanding through multi-agent cooperation
3. Provide a flexible framework for handling complex real-world documents
4. Support multiple benchmark datasets (MMLB, LDU, PTAB, PTEXT, FETA)

## Success Metrics
- Successful installation and environment setup
- Proper data extraction and preparation
- Functional text and image retrieval
- Accurate multi-agent inference
- Evaluation results showing improved performance over baseline methods
